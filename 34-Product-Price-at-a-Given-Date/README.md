| product_id    | int  |
| new_price     | int  |
| change_date   | date |

- (product_id, change_date) is the **primary key**.
- Each row indicates that the price of a product was changed to `new_price` on `change_date`.

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts Used

- Subqueries with `MAX(change_date)` to get latest change
- Handling default values for products without updates
- Filtering with `WHERE change_date <= '2019-08-16'`
- Joining result with distinct product list to include all products

## ðŸ§¾ SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT p.product_id,
       COALESCE(
         (SELECT new_price
          FROM Products p2
          WHERE p2.product_id = p.product_id
            AND p2.change_date <= '2019-08-16'
          ORDER BY p2.change_date DESC
          LIMIT 1), 10) AS price
FROM (SELECT DISTINCT product_id FROM Products) p;
