 Table: EmployeeUNI

| Column Name | Type |
|-------------|------|
| id          | int  |
| unique_id   | int  |

 Example:

Input:

Employees table:

| id | name     |
|----|----------|
| 1  | Alice    |
| 7  | Bob      |
| 11 | Meir     |
| 90 | Winston  |
| 3  | Jonathan |

EmployeeUNI table:

| id | unique_id |
|----|-----------|
| 3  | 1         |
| 11 | 2         |
| 90 | 3         |

---

Output:

| unique_id | name     |
|-----------|----------|
| null      | Alice    |
| null      | Bob      |
| 2         | Meir     |
| 3         | Winston  |
| 1         | Jonathan |

 Explanation

- Employees Alice and Bob don't have a unique ID â†’ result shows `null`.
- Others have corresponding `unique_id` values as per the `EmployeeUNI` table.
- This problem uses a LEFT JOIN to ensure all employees are included, even those missing from the `EmployeeUNI` table.
