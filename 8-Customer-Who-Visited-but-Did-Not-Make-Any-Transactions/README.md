 üîç Explanation

- Customer with `id = 23` visited once (`visit_id = 1`) and made a transaction (`transaction_id = 12`).
- Customer with `id = 9` visited once (`visit_id = 2`) and made a transaction (`transaction_id = 13`).
- Customer with `id = 30` visited once (`visit_id = 4`) and made **no transaction** ‚Üí count = 1
- Customer with `id = 54` visited **3 times** (`visit_id = 5`, `7`, `8`), and only one of those visits (`visit_id = 5`) had transactions ‚Üí count = 2
- Customer with `id = 96` visited once (`visit_id = 6`) and made **no transaction** ‚Üí count = 1
