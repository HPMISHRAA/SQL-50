## ðŸ’¡ Example

### ðŸ‘‡ Input:

**Teacher table:**

| teacher_id | subject_id | dept_id |
|------------|------------|---------|
| 1          | 2          | 3       |
| 1          | 2          | 4       |
| 1          | 3          | 3       |
| 2          | 1          | 1       |
| 2          | 2          | 1       |
| 2          | 3          | 1       |
| 2          | 4          | 1       |

---

### ðŸ“¤ Output:

| teacher_id | cnt |
|------------|-----|
| 1          | 2   |
| 2          | 4   |

---

## ðŸ§  Explanation

- **Teacher 1** teaches subject `2` in multiple departments, but we only count unique `subject_id`s. So: `2 subjects` â†’ (2, 3)
- **Teacher 2** teaches 4 different subjects â†’ (1, 2, 3, 4)

---

## ðŸ§® SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT 
  teacher_id,
  COUNT(DISTINCT subject_id) AS cnt
FROM Teacher
GROUP BY teacher_id;
