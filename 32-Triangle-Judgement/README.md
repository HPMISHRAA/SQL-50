# 1789. Primary Department for Each Employee

## üîç Problem Description

**Table: Employee**

| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| employee_id   | int     |
| department_id | int     |
| primary_flag  | varchar |

- `(employee_id, department_id)` is the primary key.
- `primary_flag` is an ENUM of type (`'Y'`, `'N'`):
  - `'Y'` indicates the **primary department**.
  - `'N'` indicates a **non-primary department**.
- If an employee belongs to **only one department**, the `primary_flag` is `'N'`.

---

## üß† Objective

Write an SQL query to report all employees with their **primary department**.

- If an employee belongs to only one department, return that department.
- If an employee belongs to multiple departments, return the one with `primary_flag = 'Y'`.

## üí° Explanation

- **Employee 1** has only one department, so it's considered primary.
- **Employee 2** has two departments, but department 1 is marked as `'Y'`.
- **Employee 3** has one department, so it's considered primary.
- **Employee 4** has multiple departments; department 3 is marked `'Y'`.

## üßæ SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT employee_id, department_id
FROM Employee
WHERE primary_flag = 'Y'
   OR employee_id IN (
       SELECT employee_id
       FROM Employee
       GROUP BY employee_id
       HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
   );
