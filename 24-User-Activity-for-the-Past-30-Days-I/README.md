## ðŸ§  Explanation

- On **2019-07-20**, users `1` and `2` were active.
- On **2019-07-21**, users `2` and `3` were active.
- Only days **within the last 30 days ending 2019-07-27** are considered.
- Days with **zero active users** are excluded from the result.

## âœ… SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT
  activity_date AS day,
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS active_users
FROM Activity
WHERE activity_date BETWEEN DATE('2019-07-27') - INTERVAL 29 DAY AND '2019-07-27'
GROUP BY activity_date;
